Ilitek ILI9341 TFT panel driver with SPI control bus

This is a driver for 240x320 TFT panels, accepting a rgb input
streams that get adapted and scaled to the panel.

Required properties:
  - compatible: "stm32f429-disco,ltdc-panel", "ilitek,ili9341"
    (full system-specific compatible is always required to look up configuration)
  - reg: address of the panel on the SPI bus

Optional properties:
  - reset-gpios: a GPIO spec for the reset pin, see gpio/gpio.txt
  - dc-gpios: a GPIO spec for the dc pin, see gpio/gpio.txt

  The following optional properties only apply to RGB input mode:

  - pixelclk-active: see display/panel/display-timing.txt
  - de-active: see display/panel/display-timing.txt
  - hsync-active: see display/panel/display-timing.txt
  - vsync-active: see display/panel/display-timing.txt

The panel must obey the rules for a SPI slave device as specified in
spi/spi-bus.txt

The device node can contain one 'port' child node with one child
'endpoint' node, according to the bindings defined in
media/video-interfaces.txt. This node should describe panel's video bus.

Example:

panel: display@0 {
	compatible = "stm32f429-disco,ltdc-panel", "ilitek,ili9341";
	reg = <0>;
	spi-3wire;
	spi-max-frequency = <10000000>;
	dc-gpios = <&gpiod 13 0>;
	port {
		panel_in: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&display_out>;
		};
	};
};
